Attendance Register Module - What's New
## RELEASE 2.6 (2016113001)
*   [#2] Optimization for AMOS, the central repository of Moodle strings. Now you can
    download availables module translations simply adding/updating moodle language pack.
## RELEASE 2.6 (2016113000)
New features
*	Support for moodle 3.1

Fixes
*	session_is_loggedinas() is removed, use \core\session\manager::is_loggedinas() instead
*	Removed log recalc just after a course backup restore and added a scheduled recalc
	at next cron because during the restore process, when the function after_execute() 
	is called some log are missing (moodle bug?) causing wrong report values.

Warning
*	During a course restore (with logs) do not change the "Course start date", because 
	the logs of the new course will shift in the time adding or subtracting the time 
	difference between the old "Course start date" and the new one. In that case the
	attendance report values could change. (tested on Moodle 3.1)
*   Inside course backups made in moodle 2.7 2.8 2.9 with the new standard_log plugin 
    enabled the logs are missing due to the bug MDL-46455, so the log history in the 
    courses restored from those backups is missing and the attendance register report 
    are empty

# Bugfix and performance 2014.03.08.05
Fixes
* [#67] User session could be delayed until next login if user pauses activities
        for some time (shorter than PHP session) and the cron runs creating a 
        new session.
* [#60] Fixed typo
* Minor CSS changes for Moodle 2.6 Bootstrap-based theme
Performance fixes
* [#63, #66] A couple of changes greatly reducing the number of queries executing 
        cron (thanks to MorrisR2)

Fixes
* [#58] Removed usage of deprecated get_context_instance() function

# Bugfix 2013.07.06.01
(I've abandoned the previous version numbering, often confused with supported Moodle version number)
Fixes
* [#56] Rewritten query that determines which users must be checked for creating 
        new online sessions (used on each cron run; determines the delay on session 
        creation)
* [#57] Minor warning (in DEBUG only) when personal Register page was shown

## BUGFIX 2.4.3+ (2013050901)
Fixes

New Features
* [#7]  Added Activity Completion support, based on total tracked time
Fixes
* [#52] Fixed on-view-completion implementation (it never actually worked)
Improvements
* [#28] When a tracked user may also view other users' sessions, in user lists
        has a shortcut button to see his/her own sessions page.
* [#43] After a new instance has been created, a message is shown to explain that
        old Sessions will show on next cron run.
* [#51] Removed update-sessions-on-user-view feature, that have been hidden and 
        disabled since a long time ago

## BUGFIX 2.4.2+ (2013032201)
Fixes
* [#47] Fixed a regression bug in the improvement fix #37
* [#46] Fixed Cron not correctly recording last execution time. 
        It was executing at every cron, regardless of last execution.
        Now Moodle does not execute module cron if last execution is less than 
        5 minutes ago.
