Attendance Register is an Activity Module for Moodle 2.x Moodle 3.x

The purpose is calculating the time participants spend in a Course or a group of 
Courses. It actually does not have any "activity" to do, but extends standard 
Moodle Logging and Statistics, introducing the "time spent on Course" concept.
